# 🚀 Smart Progress Tracker (Career OS)

## Measure Real Learning Progress, Not Just Activity

A full-stack web application that tracks daily tasks and learning 
activities to measure actual progress through weighted scoring, 
skill analysis, consistency tracking, and job readiness assessment.

---

## 🎯 Problem

Traditional tools only track task completion. They don't tell you:
- Are you actually improving?
- Which skills are strong/weak?
- Are you consistent?
- Are you job-ready?

---

## 💡 Solution

Smart Progress Tracker uses **weighted scoring** to measure real progress:
Task Score = (Actual Time) × (Difficulty Multiplier) × (Completion %)

### 📈 Weighted Progress Formula

Task Score = (actualTime/60) × difficultyMultiplier × (completion/100)

Difficulty Multipliers:
  Easy   = 1.0x
  Medium = 1.5x  
  Hard   = 2.5x

Weekly Progress = (Total Score / Expected Score) × 100

---
